                                    Pedagogy & Outreach
                                    The predominant pedogogical approach of SPAV is learning by doing. Accordingly, the three planning programmes have an array of subjects which can be sgregated as theory subjects, studio subjects and lab based subjects. Teaching in SPAV is spaced into 2 semesters per annum. In each semester, there is approximately 17-18 weeks of teaching, with 35 periods per week (having 5 working days each). Out of the 35 periods per week, the majority portion is assigned to Planning Design Studio with the balance delving into theory courses. There are progressive internal assessments throughout the semester in each subject. Semester end examinations happen every April-May and November-December, which includes written, viva-voce and jury exams.
                                    For details about Studio subjects, Theory subjects, Thesis, Professional Training and Placements, click here.
